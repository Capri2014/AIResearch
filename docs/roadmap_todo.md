## Survey / reading queue (high ROI)

### Robotics foundation models (Tesla)
- **"Building foundational models for Robotics at Tesla" — Ashok Elluswamy**
  - TODO: find the primary source (talk/video/post), capture key claims, and map to actionable implications for this repo.
  - Questions to answer in the digest:
    - What is the data mixture (fleet logs / teleop / sim)?
    - What is the modeling stack (VLM, world model, policy, planning)?
    - What are the training objectives (BC, RL, self-supervised, distillation)?
    - What is the evaluation protocol and what correlates with real-world success?
  - Deliverable:
    - Add a one-page digest under `docs/digests/` with citations.
