## Decisions / confirmations
- Driving sim stack confirmed: CARLA + ScenarioRunner.
- Robotics sim priority: start with MuJoCo (easier to implement) before Isaac.

## Repo process
- Daily workflow in AIResearch repo: 1 commit/day + 1 PR/day with clawbot daily log + STATUS updates.
- PR complexity target: ~30 minutes/day of review time; keep 1 commit/day but make each PR a focused vertical slice (balanced code + research rationale).

## Research direction
- Keep “data requirements + evaluation metrics” as an always-on guiding question; plan to implement both JSON Schema + Pydantic metrics contract + validator scripts.

## Deferred / long-term topics
- "Seedance 2.0" (ByteDance) — assess potential impact on Physical AI (synthetic video/world models). Parked until deeper dive; need primary technical source/model card/paper when resuming.
