## Pipeline Work

### ResAD Implementation (Completed)
- Created `training/rl/resad.py` (800+ lines)
  - UncertaintyHead, ResADResidualHead, InertialReferenceTransform
  - ResADModule, ResADWithSFT, ResADTrainer, ResADEvaluator
  - Key features: normalized residual (Δ = (y - ŷ) / σ), uncertainty-aware training
- Created `training/rl/resad_train.py`
- Committed to `feature/grpo-implementation` branch
- Pushed to origin

### DeepSeek Engram Survey (Completed)
- Created `docs/surveys/2026-02-18-deepseek-engram.md` (626 lines)
- Research lineage analysis:
  - **Memory 支线**: FFN = KV Memory, Knowledge Neurons, RETRO, Memory Layer
  - **N-gram 支线**: Traditional N-gram → N-Grammer → Scaling Embedding
- Five core insights documented:
  1. FFN is Key-Value Memory
  2. Sparsity breaks "Impossible Triangle"
  3. Hash table enables O(1) N-gram retrieval
  4. Engram lets model "remember" commonsense without "computing"
  5. DeepSeek Engram is culmination of prior research
- MoE vs Engram comparison table
- Autonomous driving application examples (Engram + AR Decoder)
- Created new branch `feature/deepseek-engram-survey`

## Notes
- User (Qi) provided Chinese context for Engram survey analysis
- ResAD and Engram complement each other: ResAD = residual correction, Engram = knowledge retrieval
- All RL algorithms now implemented: GRPO, SAC, ResAD
