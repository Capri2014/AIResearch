## Session Notes

### Config Issue Resolved
- Root cause: `allowAgents` was added under `agents.defaults.subagents` (invalid key in OpenClaw 2026.2.6-3)
- Correct location: under `agents.list` entry for `id="main"` as `subagents.allowAgents=["pipeline","survey"]`
- User asked to stop touching gateway/OpenClaw config, focusing only on AIResearch code + survey

### PRs Pushed
1. **Speed PR** (`feature/pretrain-frame-index-fastpath`):
   - `training/episodes/episode_index.py` - CLI to build frame index from episode.json shards
   - `EpisodesFrameIndexDataset` - reads from pre-built JSONL index, avoids per-worker JSON parsing
   - Usage: `python -m training.episodes.episode_index --output /path/to/index.jsonl "glob/*.json"`

2. **Digest PR** (`feature/digest-waymo-scenediffuser`):
   - Waymo SceneDiffuser (NeurIPS 2024) - diffusion-based traffic simulation
   - Key innovations: amortized diffusion (16x faster), generalized hard constraints, LLM-guided scene gen
   - Top open-loop + best closed-loop on Waymo Sim Agents Challenge
