## Focus
Driving-first pipeline: **Waymo episodes → PyTorch SSL pretrain → waypoint BC → CARLA ScenarioRunner eval**

## Progress
- Added ADE/FDE evaluation metrics to waypoint BC trainer (`training/sft/train_waypoint_bc_torch_v0.py`)
  - Implemented `compute_ade_fde()` function for trajectory prediction evaluation
  - Collects evaluation predictions during training (last 100 valid samples)
  - Outputs standard autonomous driving metrics: Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE)
  - Metrics are written to `train_metrics.json` alongside training loss

## Changes Summary
- **Modified**: `training/sft/train_waypoint_bc_torch_v0.py` (+41 lines)
  - Added ADE/FDE computation function
  - Added eval prediction collection loop during training
  - Updated docstring and metrics output

## Next Steps
1. Run waypoint BC training with new metrics to validate ADE/FDE output
2. Add checkpoint selection based on best ADE/FDE
3. Wire `WaypointPolicyTorch` wrapper for CARLA ScenarioRunner rollouts
