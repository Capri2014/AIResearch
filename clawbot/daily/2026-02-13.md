## CL #1 (morning): optional image decode + LRU cache for episodes dataloader

### What changed
- `training/pretrain/dataloader_episodes.py`
  - Added `decode_images` flag to switch between *path-only* mode and *decoded tensor* mode.
  - Implemented a small LRU cache (`image_cache_size`) for decoded images keyed by resolved path.
  - When `decode_images=True`, the dataset now returns `images_by_cam` alongside `image_paths_by_cam`.
  - `collate_batch(...)` now carries `images_by_cam` through as lists (no stacking yet).

### Why
- Keeps “plumbing” fast (paths/metadata only) while enabling an easy on-ramp to real pretraining once we’re ready to pay the decode cost.
- LRU cache reduces repeated disk/PIL work when sampling adjacent frames / same cameras.

### Follow-ups
- Make `ImageConfig` (resize) configurable from the dataset ctor.
- Consider pinning/cache on CPU vs GPU explicitly (currently CPU tensors).
- Add a dedicated collator for stacked image batches (handle missing cameras + None paths).
