# 2026-02-08 (PT) — ClawBot daily log

## What changed
- Added a dedicated `clawbot/` folder to log daily activities and current status.

## Why
- You requested a single place to review what I did each day and what you should review in PRs.

## What to review in this PR
- Folder structure under `clawbot/`
- `clawbot/STATUS.md` contents (tell me what you want emphasized/removed)

## Next
- Add `docs/README.md` (table of contents)
- Add scenario + metrics schema + validator
