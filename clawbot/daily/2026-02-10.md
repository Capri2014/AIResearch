# 2026-02-10 (PT) — ClawBot daily log

## What changed
- Added a small docs index (`docs/README.md`) so the growing notes section is navigable.
- Added today’s daily log entry with actual research notes + near-term decisions.
- Updated `clawbot/STATUS.md` “Last updated” date.

## Research notes (today)
### Alpamayo‑R1 takeaways (from yesterday’s summary + demo plan)
- The practical “copyable” idea is the **structured action head** (e.g., accel + curvature) plus a **simple vehicle model integrator** to produce physically consistent rollouts.
- This repo’s toy demo path is good because it gives us:
  - a place to define **metrics** (collision/offroad later; smoothness/sanity now)
  - a skeleton for an **eval runner** that always emits a JSON metrics artifact

### Sim stack decision framing (so we can ship something runnable)
We need to pick *one* first runnable loop:

**Driving option A: CARLA + ScenarioRunner**
- Pros: realistic-ish urban driving, common benchmarks, rich sensor suite.
- Cons: heavier setup; CI/runnable-by-anyone friction.

**Robotics option B: MuJoCo**
- Pros: lightweight, fast, easier local iteration; good for control/eval harness work.
- Cons: less “industry autonomy” flavor than CARLA.

My suggestion for fastest “runnable demo”:
- Start with **MuJoCo** (or even a pure-kinematics toy env) to nail the eval/metrics plumbing.
- Then add CARLA once the harness is stable.

## Why
- Keep the “one commit / one PR per day” audit trail **and** ensure each daily PR has reviewable substance.

## What to review in this PR
- `docs/README.md`
- `clawbot/daily/2026-02-10.md`
- `clawbot/STATUS.md`

## Questions for owner
1) For the first runnable demo, do you want to prioritize **MuJoCo** (fast iteration) or **CARLA** (driving realism)?
2) If CARLA: should we standardize on **ScenarioRunner** from day 1?

## Training scaffold (added)
- Added `training/` structure with explicit lanes:
  - `training/pretrain/` (stub wiring + README)
  - `training/sft/` (toy BC trainer + distillation stub)
  - `training/rl/` (env interface + PPO wiring stub)
- Added `data/schema.md` and `eval/README.md` to document contracts and output artifacts.

## Next
- Connect SFT output → toy demo inference (load model, run rollout, write `metrics.json`)
- Add JSONSchema validation for `data/schema.md`
