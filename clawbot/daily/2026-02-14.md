## What I shipped
- Fixed a hard crash in `training/pretrain/train_ssl_contrastive_v0.py`: the encoder was moved to `device` before `device` was defined.

## Notes
- This unblocks running the SSL contrastive v0 pretrain end-to-end on episode shards (next: run + record throughput/memory).

## Focus
Driving-first execution: **Waymo episodes → PyTorch SSL pretrain → waypoint BC → CARLA ScenarioRunner**.

## CL #1: make Waymo episode shards portable (relative `image_path` by default)

### What changed
- `data/waymo/convert.py`
  - TFRecord conversion now writes `image_path` as a path **relative to the episode JSON directory** (e.g. `images/<timestamp>_<cam>.jpg`) by default.
  - Added flags:
    - `--relative-image-paths` (default)
    - `--absolute-image-paths` (opt-out)

### Why
- Absolute paths make episode shards non-portable and break downstream training when moved between machines / environments.
- `training/pretrain/dataloader_episodes.py` already resolves relative paths against the episode JSON’s directory, so this makes the “Waymo → episodes → pretrain dataloader” contract cleaner and more robust.

### Follow-ups
- Decide whether to enforce relative paths in schema validation (or allow both but recommend relative).
- Add a tiny smoke test: convert a short TFRecord and load with `EpisodesFrameDataset(decode_images=True)`.
