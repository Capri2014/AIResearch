## What I shipped
- Fixed a hard crash in `training/pretrain/train_ssl_contrastive_v0.py`: the encoder was moved to `device` before `device` was defined.
- Added temporal SSL plumbing: an episodes-backed temporal-pair dataset + a minimal `train_ssl_temporal_contrastive_v0.py` script for InfoNCE on (t, t+k) within the same camera.

## Notes
- This enables the next planned SSL upgrade (temporal positives) without changing the existing multi-camera contrastive script.
- Next: run on real Waymo episode shards and record throughput/memory; tune loader knobs + cache sizing.
