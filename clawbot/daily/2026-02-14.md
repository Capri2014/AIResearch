## What changed today
- Waymo episode converter: make `image_path` portable + schema-compliant
  - Always write `frames[*].observations.cameras[*].image_path` as a **relative** path (`images/<ts>_<cam>.jpg`).
  - In `--no-write-images` mode, still emit deterministic relative paths (skip bytes I/O) so episodes still validate against `data/schema/episode.json`.
  - Synthetic (contract) episodes now also use relative `images/...` paths.

## Why it matters
- Episode shards become copyable/mountable across machines without path rewrites.
- Fixes a latent schema mismatch (`image_path` was `null` in `--no-write-images` mode).

## Next
- Run a smoke conversion on a small TFRecord (w/ and w/o `--no-write-images`) + validate against the JSON schema.
- Wire relative-path resolution into the PyTorch episodes dataloader (join on episode root).
