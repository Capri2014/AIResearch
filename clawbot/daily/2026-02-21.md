## Pipeline PR #6: Deterministic Evaluation for Waypoint RL

### Summary
Added deterministic evaluation script that compares SFT-only vs RL-refined policies on the toy waypoint environment. Outputs metrics in standard schema format.

### Commits
- `c89df26` - feat(eval): Add deterministic evaluation for waypoint RL with SFT vs RL comparison

### New Files
- `training/rl/eval_waypoint_rl.py` - Deterministic evaluation script

### Architecture
```
SFT policy: linear interpolation to goal
RL policy:  SFT_waypoints + delta_head(z)
```

### Key Features
- **Deterministic evaluation**: Fixed seeds for reproducibility
- **SFT vs RL comparison**: Side-by-side evaluation on same episodes
- **Standard metrics schema**: Outputs to `out/eval/<run_id>/metrics.json`
- **3-line report**: Quick summary of comparison

### Usage
```bash
# Full evaluation (20 episodes)
python3 training/rl/eval_waypoint_rl.py --num-episodes 20 --output-dir out/eval

# Smoke test (5 episodes)
python3 training/rl/eval_waypoint_rl.py --smoke --output-dir out/eval

# With checkpoint
python3 training/rl/eval_waypoint_rl.py --checkpoint path/to/checkpoint.pt
```

### Demo Results (20 episodes)
```
SFT:  ADE=3.568m, FDE=2.752m, Success=30.0%
RL:   ADE=59.583m, FDE=83.603m, Success=0.0%
Delta: ADE=-1570.1%, FDE=-2938.1%, Success=-30.0%
```

Note: RL performs worse than SFT in this run because we used untrained random weights. The evaluation framework correctly captures and compares both policies.

### Output
- `out/eval/waypoint_rl_eval_<timestamp>/metrics.json` - Full metrics in schema format

## Pipeline PR #5: PPO Residual Delta-Waypoint Training

### Summary
Added PPO stub for RL refinement after SFT with toy waypoint environment. Implements residual delta-waypoint learning where final_waypoints = SFT_waypoints + delta_head(encoding).

### Commits
- `feature/daily-2026-02-21-e` - feat(rl): Add PPO residual delta-waypoint training with toy environment

### New Files
- `training/rl/waypoint_env.py` - Toy kinematics environment for waypoint testing
- `training/rl/ppo_residual_waypoint.py` - PPO with residual delta learning
- `training/rl/__init__.py` - Module initialization

### Architecture
```
final_waypoints = sft_waypoints + delta_head(z)
```

### Key Components
- **WaypointEnv**: Simple 2D navigation with state (x, y, vx, vy, goal_x, goal_y)
- **SFTWaypointModel**: Mock SFT model (frozen) for baseline waypoint predictions
- **DeltaWaypointHead**: Trainable residual head
- **PPOResidualWaypointAgent**: PPO training with GAE, value loss, entropy bonus
- **Metrics**: episode_rewards, goals_reached, policy/value losses

### Results (50 episodes)
- Final avg reward: -3496.36
- Goal rate: 0.10

## Pipeline PR #4: RL to CARLA Pipeline Integration

### Summary
Added end-to-end pipeline script that integrates RL training output with CARLA closed-loop evaluation.

### Commits
- `77796a0` - feat(eval): Add RL to CARLA pipeline for end-to-end evaluation

### New Files
- `training/eval/run_rl_to_carla_pipeline.py` - Pipeline integration script

### Architecture
```
RL training output → Best checkpoint selection → CARLA closed-loop eval → Comparison report
```

### Key Features
- **Automatic checkpoint selection**: Selects best checkpoint from training metrics (by reward)
- **SFT comparison**: Supports --compare-sft flag to compare SFT vs RL in CARLA
- **Metrics**: Route completion, collision rate improvements
- **Smoke test**: --smoke flag for testing without CARLA

### Usage
```bash
# Evaluate RL model in CARLA
python -m training.eval.run_rl_to_carla_pipeline \
  --rl-run-dir out/rl_delta_waypoint/2026-02-20_19-31-52 \
  --output-dir out/rl_carla_eval

# Compare SFT vs RL
python -m training.eval.run_rl_to_carla_pipeline \
  --rl-run-dir out/rl_delta_waypoint/2026-02-20_19-31-52 \
  --output-dir out/rl_carla_eval \
  --compare-sft

# Smoke test
python -m training.eval.run_rl_to_carla_pipeline \
  --rl-run-dir out/rl_delta_waypoint/2026-02-20_19-31-52 \
  --output-dir out/rl_carla_eval \
  --smoke
```

## Pipeline PR #3: Waypoint Trajectory Smoothing

### Summary
Added trajectory smoothing module for post-processing waypoint predictions to ensure kinematic feasibility.

### Commits
- `9be2cb5` - feat(rl): Add waypoint trajectory smoothing for kinematic feasibility

### New Files
- `training/rl/waypoint_smoothing.py` - Core smoothing module
- `training/rl/test_waypoint_smoothing.py` - Smoke tests

### Architecture
```
final_waypoints = smooth(delta_head(z) + sft_waypoints)
```

### Key Features
- **Smoothing methods**: Exponential, Moving Average, Savitzky-Golay
- **Kinematic feasibility**: Speed/acceleration limits enforcement
- **Learnable smoothing**: PyTorch module for differentiable training
- **ADE improvement**: 0.631m → 0.477m on noisy trajectories

### Usage
```python
from training.rl.waypoint_smoothing import (
    WaypointSmootherConfig,
    smooth_waypoints
)

config = WaypointSmootherConfig(
    smoothing_window=5,
    apply_speed_profile=True,
    max_speed=15.0,
    max_acceleration=3.0
)
smoothed = smooth_waypoints(waypoints, config, method="savgol")
```
